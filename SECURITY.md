# Reporting Security Issues

As this is a small fork, it is better to first verify if the issue is relevant to only the fork, or if it is also relevant to the base repository owned by @mauriciolauffer: [https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/wdio-qunit-service]. If it is relevant to the base repository, please follow @mauriciolauffer's original instructions:

> To report a security issue, contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mauriciolauffer) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mauriciolauffer) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.
>
> If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, a Security Advisory will be open and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.

If the issue applies _only to this fork_, please create an issue on the repository with details: [https://github.com/pmoeller91-yottaa/wdio-qunit-service]. There are no guarantees for response timelines for this minor fork.
